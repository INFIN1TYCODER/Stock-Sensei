# Stock-Sensei
It is a website that presents a graph representation of all the major company share prices present in the United States and a brief explanation about those companies. Created it using Python and Streamlit. Using python, I was able to create the graph representation of the stock prices and extract the necessary data/information from the multiple websites. Using Streamlit I was able to host the Python code onto the net and was able to enhance the graph representation and add multiple functions to it. Along with representing the stock prices through graph, the website also included the function to predict the stock price for the next 20 sec using Fibonacci series in stock analysis.
